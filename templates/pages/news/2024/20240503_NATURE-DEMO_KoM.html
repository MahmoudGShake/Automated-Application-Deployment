                      is a project funded by the European Union through the
                      Horizon Europe Programme (Grant No. 101157448). The
                      NATURE-DEMO project starts on May 1st, 2024 for a duration
                      of 48 months, and involves a consortium of leading
                      European research and industry partners. The project's
                      goal is to validate a general methodology for prioritising
                      natural-based solutions (NbS) and their integration into
                      a digital platform, addressing climatic threats such as
                      floods, landslides, and wildfires on civil engineering
                      infrastructure. The project will demonstrate the
                      effectiveness of NbS in safeguarding critical
                      infrastructure, thereby supporting people in areas
                      vulnerable to climate impacts.

                      The <b>kick-off meeting</b> of the NATURE-DEMO project is
                      designed to initiate the project by bringing together all
                      consortium partners and relevant stakeholders to establish
                      a shared understanding and commitment to the project
                      objectives. The primary goals of this meeting are to
                      introduce the project's overarching framework and
                      individual work packages, clarify the roles and
                      responsibilities of each partner, and foster collaborative
                      relationships among partners. Additionally, the meeting
                      aims to facilitate discussions on strategic approaches to
                      implementing NbS for enhancing
                      climate resilience, ensuring alignment with the needs of
                      local and regional authorities, and setting the groundwork
                      for effective project management and communication.

                      To maximise NATURE-DEMO impact and enlarge its scope of

                      operation and provide practical insights to achieve
                      NATURE-DEMO’s expected outcomes and the desired impacts.
                      NATURE-DEMO will leverage its AB members' strong
                      industrial, regulatory, and academic experience and invite

                      will consolidate the discussions, insights, and

                      this session will be led by the project Coordinator, who
                      will summarise the key outcomes of each session,
                      emphasizing the strategic directions and consensus reached
                      on the project's implementation. It will also reaffirm the
                      roles and expectations of each partner, ensuring alignment
                      and commitment towards the shared goals. The coordinator
                      will address any final queries and outline the next steps,
                      including immediate actions and timelines for upcoming

                      their responsibilities and the project's trajectory,
